Contributor Guidelines
======================

This document will go through best practices for contributing to this
project. We welcome and appreciate contributions or ideas for
improvement.

-  `Bug Reports and Feature
   Requests <#bug-reports-and-feature-requests>`__
-  `Local Installation for
   Development <#local-installation-for-development>`__
-  `Branches and Pull Requests <#branches-and-pull-requests>`__
-  `Release Cycles <#release-cycles>`__

Bug Reports and Feature Requests
--------------------------------

Before creating a pull request, we ask contributors to please open a bug
report or feature request first:
`issues <https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-data-access-api/issues/new/choose>`__

We will do our best to monitor and maintain the backlog of issues.

Local Installation for Development
----------------------------------

For development,

-  For new features or non-urgent bug fixes, create a branch off of
   ``dev``
-  For an urgent hotfix to our production environment, create a branch
   off of ``main``

Consult the `Branches and Pull Requests <#branches-and-pull-requests>`__
and `Release Cycles <#release-cycles>`__ for more details.

From the root directory, run:

.. code:: bash

   pip install -e .[dev]

to install the relevant code for development.

Branches and Pull Requests
--------------------------

Branch naming conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Name your branch using the following format:
``<type>-<issue_number>-<short_summary>``

where:

-  ``<type>`` is one of:

   -  **build**: Changes that affect the build system
      or external dependencies (e.g., pyproject.toml, setup.py)
   -  **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
      (examples: .github/workflows/ci.yml)
   -  **docs**: Changes to our documentation
   -  **feat**: A new feature
   -  **fix**: A bug fix
   -  **perf**: A code change that improves performance
   -  **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds
      a feature, but will make the codebase easier to maintain
   -  **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
   -  **hotfix**: An urgent bug fix to our production code
-  ``<issue_number>`` references the GitHub issue this branch will close
-  ``<short_summary>`` is a brief description that shouldn’t be more than 3
   words.

Some examples:

-  ``feat-12-adds-email-field``
-  ``fix-27-corrects-endpoint``
-  ``test-43-updates-server-test``

We ask that a separate issue and branch are created if code is added
outside the scope of the reference issue.

Commit messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please format your commit messages as ``<type>: <short summary>`` where
``<type>`` is from the list above and the short summary is one or two
sentences.

Testing and docstrings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We strive for complete code coverage and docstrings, and we also run
code format checks.

-  To run the code format check:

.. code:: bash

   flake8 .

-  There are some helpful libraries that will automatically format the
   code and import statements:

.. code:: bash

   black .

and

.. code:: bash

   isort .

Strings that exceed the maximum line length may still need to be
formatted manually.

-  To run the docstring coverage check and report:

.. code:: bash

   interrogate -v .

This project uses NumPy’s docstring format: `Numpy docstring
standards <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html>`__

Many IDEs can be configured to automatically format docstrings in the
NumPy convention.

-  To run the unit test coverage check and report:

.. code:: bash

   coverage run -m unittest discover && coverage report

-  To view a more detailed html version of the report, run:

.. code:: bash

   coverage run -m unittest discover && coverage report
   coverage html

and then open ``htmlcov/index.html`` in a browser.

Pull Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pull requests and reviews are required before merging code into this
project. You may open a ``Draft`` pull request and ask for a preliminary
review on code that is currently a work-in-progress.

Before requesting a review on a finalized pull request, please verify
that the automated checks have passed first.

Release Cycles
--------------------------

For this project, we have adopted the `Git
Flow <https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/git-flow>`__ system. We will
strive to release new features and bug fixes on a two week cycle. The
rough workflow is:

Hotfixes
~~~~~~~~

-  A ``hotfix`` branch is created off of ``main``
-  A Pull Request into is ``main`` is opened, reviewed, and merged into
   ``main``
-  A new ``tag`` with a patch bump is created, and a new ``release`` is
   deployed
-  The ``main`` branch is merged into all other branches

Feature branches and bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  A new branch is created off of ``dev``
-  A Pull Request into ``dev`` is opened, reviewed, and merged

Release branch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  A new branch ``release-v{new_tag}`` is created
-  Documentation updates and bug fixes are created off of the
   ``release-v{new_tag}`` branch.
-  Commits added to the ``release-v{new_tag}`` are also merged into
   ``dev``
-  Once ready for release, a Pull Request from ``release-v{new_tag}``
   into ``main`` is opened for final review
-  A new tag will automatically be generated
-  Once merged, a new GitHub Release is created manually

Pre-release checklist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ☐ Increment ``__version__`` in
   ``src/aind_data_access_api/__init__.py`` file
-  ☐ Run linters, unit tests, and integration tests
-  ☐ Verify code is deployed and tested in test environment
-  ☐ Update examples
-  ☐ Update documentation

   -  Run:

   .. code:: bash

      sphinx-apidoc -o docs/source/ src
      sphinx-build -b html docs/source/ docs/build/html

-  ☐ Update and build UML diagrams

   -  To build UML diagrams locally using a docker container:

   .. code:: bash

      docker pull plantuml/plantuml-server
      docker run -d -p 8080:8080 plantuml/plantuml-server:jetty

Post-release checklist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ☐ Merge ``main`` into ``dev`` and feature branches
-  ☐ Edit release notes if needed
-  ☐ Post announcement
